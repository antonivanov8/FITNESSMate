About the application
This is my first complete program. 
It took me about one and a half months to build it and I have used Java, JavaFX, FXML, CSS, SceneBuilder and InteliJ to create it.

The main purpuse of the app is to help people track their workout progress. 
The users can submit their body measurements , everyday exercises and nutritions.

About the code
There is a lot of place for improvement in all arias (exception handling, reusability, naming, etc.) and I'm going to work hard to get everything done properly asap.
